  title = {A {{Review}} of {{Hazardous Chemical Species Associated}} with {{CO2 Capturefrom Coal}}-{{Fired Power Plants}} and {{Their Potential Fate}} in {{CO2 GeologicStorage}}},
  abstract = {Conventional coal-burning power plants are major contributors of excess CO2 to the atmospheric inventory. Because such plants are stationary, they are particularly amenable to CO2 capture and disposal by deep injection into confined geologic formations. However, the energy penalty for CO2 separation and compression is steep, and could lead to a 30-40 percent reduction in useable power output. Integrated gas combined cycle (IGCC) plants are thermodynamically more efficient, i.e.,produce less CO2 for a given power output, and are more suitable for CO2 capture. Therefore, if CO2 capture and deep subsurface disposal were to be considered seriously, the preferred approach would be to build replacement IGCC plants with integrated CO2 capture, rather than retrofit existing conventional plants. Coal contains minor quantities of sulfur and nitrogen compounds, which are of concern, as their release into the atmosphere leads to the formation of urban ozone and acid rain, the destruction of stratospheric ozone, and global warming. Coal also contains many trace elements that are potentially hazardous to human health and the environment. During CO2 separation and capture, these constituents could inadvertently contaminate the separated CO2 and be co-injected. The concentrations and speciation of the co-injected contaminants would differ markedly, depending on whether CO2 is captured during the operation of a conventional or an IGCC plant, and the specific nature of the plant design and CO2 separation technology. However, regardless of plant design or separation procedures, most of the hazardous constituents effectively partition into the solid waste residue. This would lead to an approximately two order of magnitude reduction in contaminant concentration compared with that present in the coal. Potential exceptions are Hg in conventional plants, and Hg and possibly Cd, Mo and Pb in IGCC plants. CO2 capture and injection disposal could afford an opportunity to deliberately capture environmental pollutants in the gaseous state and co-inject them with the CO2, in order to mitigate problems associated with solid waste disposal in surface impoundments. Under such conditions, the injected pollutant concentrations could be roughly equivalent to their concentrations in the coal feed. The fate of the injected contaminants can only be determined through further testing and geochemical modeling. However, the concentrations of inadvertent contaminants in the injected CO2 would probably be comparable to their ambient concentrations in confining shales of the injection zone. In general, the aqueous concentrations of hazardous constituents in distal parts of the injection zone, regardless of source, are likely to be limited by equilibrium with respect to coexisting solid phases under the acid conditions induced by the dissolved high pressure CO2, rather than by the initial concentrations of injected contaminants. Therefore, even if a deliberate policy of contaminant recovery and injection were to be pursued, water quality in USDWs would more likely depend on thermodynamic controls governing aqueous contaminant concentrations in the presence of high pressure CO2 rather than in the injected CO2. The conclusions reached in this report are preliminary, and should be confirmed through more comprehensive data evaluation and supporting geochemical modeling.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic effects on climate can be mitigated through various measures, among them being CO2 sequestration in geological media. Geological sinks for CO2 do not really need any major technological development because the technology has already been developed and applied by the upstream energy industry for hydrocarbon exploration and production. The challenge is rather to identify the best methods and sites for long term CO2 sequestration. There are various ways to sequester CO2 in geological media: utilization in EOR operations, disposal in disused oil and gas reservoirs, replacement of methane in coal beds, injection in deep saline aquifers and storage in salt caverns. Several criteria have to be considered when evaluating the potential of a sedimentary basin for CO2 sequestration: its tectonic setting and geology, the basin geothermal regime, the hydrodynamic regime of formation waters, the hydrocarbon potential and basin maturity, economic aspects relating to access and infrastructure and socio\textendash{}political conditions. The range of sedimentary basins suitable for CO2 sequestration is significantly reduced if these criteria and climatic conditions, accessibility, infrastructure and cost of CO2 capture and injection are taken into account. A systematic approach is proposed for the assessment and selection of method and sites for CO2 sequestration in geological media.},

The overall success rate obtained by integrating six different datasets was 39\%, although some individual techniques, such as one NDVI survey, achieved a 47\% success rate. While the work did discover some vents that were previously unknown, it also failed to locate five vents that are known to exist and, perhaps, other unknown vents.

  abstract = {Carbon storage in deep saline reservoirs has the potential to lower the amount of CO2 emitted to the atmosphere and to mitigate global warming. Leakage back to the atmosphere through abandoned wells and along faults would reduce the efficiency of carbon storage, possibly leading to health and ecological hazards at the ground surface, and possibly impacting water quality of near-surface dilute aquifers. We use static equilibrium and reactive transport simulations to test the hypothesis that perturbations in water chemistry associated with a CO2 gas leak into dilute groundwater are important measures for the potential release of CO2 to the atmosphere. Simulation parameters are constrained by groundwater chemistry, flow, and lithology from the High Plains aquifer. The High Plains aquifer is used to represent a typical sedimentary aquifer overlying a deep CO2 storage reservoir. Specifically, we address the relationships between CO2 flux, groundwater flow, detection time and distance. The CO2 flux ranges from 103 to 2 \texttimes{} 106 t/yr (0.63 to 1250 t/m2/yr) to assess chemical perturbations resulting from relatively small leaks that may compromise long-term storage, water quality, and surface ecology, and larger leaks characteristic of short-term well failure.},

Striking images of the CO2 plume have been obtained, showing a multi-tier feature of high reflectivity, interpreted as arising from a number of thin layers of CO2 trapped beneath thin, intra-reservoir mudstones. The topmost layer of the CO2 plume can be characterized most accurately, and its rate of growth quantified. From this the CO2 flux arriving at the reservoir top can be estimated. This is mostly controlled by pathway flow through the intra-reservoir mudstones. Flow has increased steadily with time suggesting that pathway transmissivities are increasing with time, and/or the pathways are becoming more numerous. Detailed 3D history-matching of the topmost layer cannot easily reproduce the observed rate of lateral spreading. Very high reservoir permeabilities seem likely, possibly with a degree of anisotropy. Other modelling variables under investigation include topseal topography, the number of feeder pathways and CO2 properties. Detailed studies such as this will provide important constraints on longer-term predictive models of plume evolution.},

  abstract = {A review has been undertaken of small scale injection projects of less than 100,000 tonnes (t) of CO2 from around the world, with the objective of assisting countries or organisations wishing to embark on their first CO2 injection test, in a cost effective, time efficient and safe manner. The mean amount of CO2 injected per project was approximately 1,000 t; only 9 out of the 45 projects had injected more than 10,000 t. Costs varied greatly from less than \$1 million to \$100 million, with the mean total cost in the range of \$10-20 million. Half of the projects were based on injection into sandstone reservoirs, although a significant number (28\%) involved injection into coals. The source of the CO2 was quite variable; the majority of the CO2 was transported by truck to the site. The depth of injection ranged from approximately 300m to over 4,000m but averaged around 1,200m. The time taken from making the preliminary decision to undertake a project to injection of the first molecule of CO2 was variable but averaged approximately three years. Generally, small scale projects are opportunistic, typically initiated by research organisations; they rely on an alliance with industrial partners for operational expertise and access to suitable locations. In most small scale projects, pre-drill reservoir characterisation consists of the integration of pre-existing geological and hydrological data. Saline reservoir sites are usually data deficient. Reservoir simulations are performed routinely, using a variety of codes, to assess CO2 injection tests and provide valuable information for system design, permitting, and monitoring. The simulations are also useful for providing a systematic framework for integrating site characterisation data, visualisation of model results provide a valuable communication tool. Documentation of storage risk assessment by projects was limited. Monitoring programs for the test injection projects were opportunistic to some degree, utilising existing data to help in establishing a baseline and commonly utilising existing wells for down-hole observations and monitoring-based sampling. Nearly all projects undertook pressure and temperature monitoring as a standard. These small scale projects offer a cost effective way of demonstrating storage technologies in CCS, assisting the progression towards large scale injections.},

  abstract = {SPE Member Abstract The source of carbon dioxide (CO2) break-through is masked for production wells in the interior of a CO2 miscible flood. An inexpensive, safe, and continuous tracer is desirable to monitor the flood performance. Halogen compounds (specifically halocarbon-11, halocarbon-12 and sulfur hexafluoride) have been used successfully to identify the source of produced carbon dioxide in a field-wide miscible produced carbon dioxide in a field-wide miscible flood project. Introduction Carbon dioxide injection at the Alvord South (Caddo Conglomerate) Unit in Wise County, Texas began in 1981, with intermittent injection prior to the beginning of sustained CO2 injection in September, 1983. It was recognized that the source of CO2 breakthrough would be masked for production wells in the interior of the flood production wells in the interior of the flood and that an inexpensive, safe and continuous tracer would be desirable to monitor the CO2 flood performance. Halogen compounds (halocarbon-11, halocarbon-12, halocarbon-113, and sulfur hexafluoride) were chosen as tracers because of their low cost and low detection limits (as low as 0.5 ppb in laboratory tests on produced fluids). Injection of these four produced fluids). Injection of these four tracers into nine CO2 injection wells began in July, 1984. By the end of 1984, tracer break-through had been observed in eight of the twenty-three production wells. The data indicate that adsorption of these tracers is insignificant and that the tracer remains with the CO2 throughout the flood process. The data obtained from this on-going process. The data obtained from this on-going tracer effort have allowed for an estimate of the approximate volumetric sweep efficiency and the identification of the source of CO2 break-through, leading to a modification of the injection scheme to improve the sweep efficiency. Halocarbon-113 has, however, been found to be useless as a tracer in this field test due to contamination of the sampling cylinders during the assembly process. Background The Alvord South (Caddo Conglomerate) Field is located on the northern flank of the Fort Worth Basin in Wise County, Texas, approximately five miles southeast of the City of Alvord. The field was discovered in October 1961 and the Alvord South (Caddo Conglomerate) Unit was formed on December 1, 1966. The Unit, operated by Mitchell Energy Corporation, covers 2,291 acres and produces from five layers of segmented, conglomerate pods with little or no vertical communication and at an average depth of 5,700 feet. Only three of these five Pennsylvanian Age Strawn series zones have Pennsylvanian Age Strawn series zones have significant areal extent. The waterflood has been quite successful, with a peak oil production rate of over 21000 BOPD in 1977 and expected ultimate recovery due to primary and secondary operations of 32\% of the original-oil-inplace. Immediately prior to sustained CO2 injection, Unit production totaled about 500 BOPD.},

  abstract = {To understand the mechanism of diel variation pattern of CH4 emission from the freshwater marsh, we measured CH4 emission as well as temperature, redox potential and CH4 concentration in porewater in situ in Sanjiang plain, northeast China. There was an apparent diel variation in CH4 emission with the peak at 9:00 and the lowest at 0:00. However, the difference between the highest and lowest emissions was much smaller in the Deyeuxia angustifolia site than in the Carex lasiocarpa site. In the D. angustifolia site with 3 cm standing water, the diel CH4 emission varied from 6.7 to 8.2 mg CH4 m-2 h-1 since plants only mediated 29\% of CH4 emission and CH4 flux increased by merely 8\% after plants were covered with a black cloth. In contrast, in the C. lasiocarpa site with 16 cm standing water where plants released 81\% of CH4 emission and CH4 flux enhanced by 19\% after plants were covered, the diel CH4 emission ranged from 19.5 to 29.7 mg CH4 m-2 h-1. At this site CH4 emission was significantly correlated to mean CH4 concentration in porewater and the latter was related to redox potential. The diel pattern could be explained by change in CH4 oxidation driven by plant photosynthesis. Oxygen generated by plant photosynthesis in the rhizome or rhizosphere and temperature in the vertical profile gradually incremented and reached the peak with a lag time after sunrise. CH4 emission and concentration in porewater increased with temperature when CH4 oxidation was no larger than CH4 production and attained the peak at 9:00 but then decreased when CH4 oxidation was larger than CH4 production. Although less fresh oxygen was transported into the rhizome or rhizosphere after sunset, CH4 oxidation was still driven by oxygen inputted at daytime. When the decreasing CH4 oxidation was again equal to CH4 production, CH4 emission and concentration reached the lowest at midnight and then increased.},

Crop monitoring in precision agriculture may be achieved by a multiplicity of technologies; however the use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) results in low-cost and low-power consumption deployments, therefore becoming a dominant option. It is also well-known that crops are also negatively affected by intruders (human or animals) and by insufficient control of the production process. Video-surveillance is a solution to detect and identify intruders as well as to better take care of the production process. In this paper, a new platform called Integrated WSN Solution for Precision Agriculture is proposed. The only cost-effective technology employed is IEEE 802.15.4, and it efficiently integrates crop data acquisition, data transmission to the end-user and video-surveillance tasks. This platform has been evaluated for the particular scenario of scattered crops video-surveillance by using computer simulation and analysis. The telecommunications metrics of choice are energy consumed, probability of frame collision and end-to-end latency, which have been carefully studied to offer the most appropriate wireless network operation. Wireless node prototypes providing agriculture data monitoring, motion detection, camera sensor and long distance data transmission (in the order of several kilometers) are developed. The performance evaluation of this real tests-bed scenario demonstrates the feasibility of the platform designed and confirms the simulation and analytical results.},

However, the daily net CO2 exchange measured by eddy covariance revealed the opposite trend, with greater carbon accumulation during the dry season. A reduction in respiration during the dry season was an important cause of this seasonal pattern. The surface litter was desiccated in the dry season, and the seasonal pattern of respiration appears to be a direct result of reduced forest floor decomposition during drought.

Reinjection of CO2 into producing natural gas reservoirs is considered as a promising technology to improve gas recovery, mitigate atmospheric emissions and control climate change. However, natural gas and CO2 are miscible at reservoir conditions and could result in CO2 contamination of produced natural gas. This mixing process and consequently the viability of Enhanced Gas Recovery (EGR) projects can be quantitatively determined by reservoir simulations \textendash{} such simulations require a description of gas dispersion. Here we conduct fluid transport experiments through carbonate and sandstone rock cores at various reservoir conditions to evaluate the effect of medium heterogeneity on the dispersion between supercritical CO2 and CH4, accounting for erroneous contributions from entrance/exit and gravitational effects. Early breakthrough and long-tailed profiles are observed for one of the carbonate cores (Ketton) which is attributed to the existence of intra-grain micro-pores, which results in a persistent pre-asymptotic transport regime. Thus a revised model (Mobile-Immobile Model) was successfully used for this core to obtain dispersion coefficients characteristic of the eventual asymptotic regime. Both heterogeneous carbonate rocks considered exhibit higher dispersion than that observed in previously-measured homogeneous sandstone cores (Honari et al., 2013). The power law describing the dependency of dispersion coefficient on P{\'e}clet number at comparatively high interstitial displacement velocities gave an exponent of 1.2 for sandstones and 1.4 for carbonates, consistent with literature predictions (Bijeljic and Blunt, 2006; Bijeljic et al., 2011) based on pore-scale simulations.},

  abstract = {Methane emission from Phragmites australis and Typha latifolia stands was quantified in Lake Vesij{\"a}rvi, southern Finland. There were differences in emission rates at different times of the day in all the vegetation zones studies, but a clear pattern was found only occasionally. In the inner reed zone with shallow water (\&lt;2 cm) the lowest emissions were usually recorded at night when the rates varied from 0.5 to 11.8 mg CH4 m-2 h-1. The pattern in diel emissions became more obvious towards the end of the growing season and the difference between the night and day emissions was highest in August, when the rates were 3.3 and 85.9 mg CH4 m-2 h-1 at 00.00 and 12.00 h, respectively. Significant differences in emission rates between night and day were only recorded in August and September. In the mixed cattail\textendash{}reed zone the pattern in emission rates was more obscure than in pure stands of reed. The ratios between the lowest and highest emissions were similar to those determined in the inner reed zone; in August, when the pattern was clearest, the ratio was 0.18. No patterns of emissions were observed in the outer reed zone, where the water depth was \&gt;10 cm and the number of shoots low. The emissions were highest in this zone, but most of them took place through ebullition. In July, when the emissions were maximal, the plant-mediated rates of emissions varied from 15.5 to 80.0 mg CH4 m-2 h-1 and ebullition from 29.5 to 55.8 mg CH4 m-2 h-1. In the inner reed zone the diel changes could be related to irradiance, whereas in the mixed cattail\textendash{}reed zone this relation was not clear. The role of temperature in diel variations was even more modest than that of irradiance. Neither of the species closed stomata at night, but still showed diel patterns in lacunal methane concentrations. Methane probably escaped through the lower part (\&lt;10 cm above the sediment surface) of the stems as the lacunal methane concentrations were always highest here.},

  abstract = {Sedimentary basins in general, and deep saline aquifers in particular, are being investigated as possible repositories for large volumes of anthropogenic CO2 that must be sequestered to mitigate global warming and related climate changes. To investigate the potential for the long-term storage of CO2 in such aquifers, 1600 t of CO2 were injected at 1500 m depth into a 24-m-thick ``C'' sandstone unit of the Frio Formation, a regional aquifer in the US Gulf Coast. Fluid samples obtained before CO2 injection from the injection well and an observation well 30 m updip showed a Na\textendash{}Ca\textendash{}Cl type brine with $\sim$93,000 mg/L TDS at saturation with CH4 at reservoir conditions; gas analyses showed that CH4 comprised $\sim$95\% of dissolved gas, but CO2 was low at 0.3\%. Following CO2 breakthrough, 51 h after injection, samples showed sharp drops in pH (6.5\textendash{}5.7), pronounced increases in alkalinity (100\textendash{}3000 mg/L as HCO3) and in Fe (30\textendash{}1100 mg/L), a slug of very high DOC values, and significant shifts in the isotopic compositions of H2O, DIC, and CH4. These data, coupled with geochemical modeling, indicate corrosion of pipe and well casing as well as rapid dissolution of minerals, especially calcite and iron oxyhydroxides, both caused by lowered pH (initially $\sim$3.0 at subsurface conditions) of the brine in contact with supercritical CO2.

These geochemical parameters, together with perfluorocarbon tracer gases (PFTs), were used to monitor migration of the injected CO2 into the overlying Frio ``B'', composed of a 4-m-thick sandstone and separated from the ``C'' by $\sim$15 m of shale and siltstone beds. Results obtained from the Frio ``B'' 6 months after injection gave chemical and isotopic markers that show significant CO2 (2.9\% compared with 0.3\% CO2 in dissolved gas) migration into the ``B'' sandstone. Results of samples collected 15 months after injection, however, are ambiguous, and can be interpreted to show no additional injected CO2 in the ``B'' sandstone. The presence of injected CO2 may indicate migration from ``C'' to ``B'' through the intervening beds or, more likely, a short-term leakage through the remedial cement around the casing of a 50-year old well. Results obtained to date from four shallow monitoring groundwater wells show no brine or CO2 leakage through the Anahuac Formation, the regional cap rock.},

  abstract = {One of the proposals for large-scale sequestration of fossil fuel-derived CO2 is deep geologic disposal in depleted oil/gas reservoirs or deep aquifers. Previously published scenarios for this inadequately proven technology have either ignored or dismissed the possibility of vertical migration of gases caused by overpressure. Overpressuring of a reservoir or aquifer will be necessary in order to have acceptable rates for dispersal of injected CO2. This research describes methodology and the results of measurement of microseepage of CO2 and CH4 at a large-scale CO2-enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operation at Rangely, Colorado, USA. Shallow and deep soil gas concentrations, and direct transport of CO2 and CH4 into the atmosphere were measured. The interpretation of the measurements was complemented by both stable and radiogenic isotopic measurements of C. The results have demonstrated an estimated microseepage to the atmosphere of approximately 400 metric tonnes of CH4/a from the 78 km2 area of the Rangely field. Preliminary estimates of deep-sourced CO2 losses are \&lt;3800 tonnes/a, based on stable isotope measurements of soil gases. Several holes up to 10 m deep were drilled on, and off the field for nested gas sampling of composition and stable C isotopic ratios for CO2 and CH4. Carbon-14 measurements on CO2 from these holes indicate that deep-sourced CO2 microseepage losses were approximately 170 tonnes/a.},

  abstract = {A baseline determination of CO2 and CH4 fluxes and soil-gas concentrations of CO2 and CH4 was made over the Teapot Dome oil field in the Naval Petroleum Reserve 3 in Natrona County, Wyoming, United States. This was done in anticipation of the experimentation with CO2 sequestration in the Pennsylvanian Tensleep Sandstone underlying the field at a depth of 5500 ft (1680 m). The measurements were made in January 2004 to capture the system with minimum biological activity in the soils, resulting in a minimum CO2 flux and a maximum CH4 flux. The CO2 fluxes were measured in the field with an infrared spectroscopic method. The CH4 fluxes were determined from gas-chromatographic measurements on discrete samples from under the flux chambers. The CO2 and CH4 were determined at 30-, 60-, and 100-cm (11-, 23-, and 39-in.) depths in soil gas by gas chromatography. A total of 40 locations had triplicate flux measurements using 1.00-m2 (10.763-ft2) chambers, and soil gas was sampled at single points at each of the 40 locations.
Carbon dioxide fluxes averaged 227.1 mg CO2 mminus2 dayminus1, a standard deviation of 186.9 mg mminus2 dayminus1, and a range of minus281.7 to 732.9 mg mminus2 dayminus1, not including one location with subsurface infrastructure contamination. Methane fluxes averaged 0.137 mg CH4 mminus2 dayminus1, standard deviation of 0.326 mg mminus2 dayminus1, and a range of minus0.481 to 1.14 mg mminus2 dayminus1, not including the same contaminated location.
Soil-gas CO2 concentrations increased with depth, averaging 618, 645, and 1010 ppmv at 30, 60, and 100 cm (11, 23, and 39 in.), respectively. Soil-gas CH4 concentrations averaged 0.128, 0.114, and 0.093 ppmv at 30, 60, and 100 cm (11, 23, and 39 in.), respectively. The decrease in CH4 with depth reflects a slow rate of methanotrophic oxidation, even during winter conditions. The delta13C of the soil gas CO2 was also determined in the soil-gas samples and in the atmosphere. These data demonstrated that the increased CO2 with depth was derived from the biological oxidation of soil organic matter.},

  abstract = {A summary of geochemical techniques for purposes of determination of a baseline condition and subsequent monitoring of potential gas microseepage from CO2-EOR or geologic sequestration is presented. The methods include; above ground open-atmosphere techniques, measurements at the land surface\textendash{}atmosphere interface, and shallow subsurface sampling and measurements. The advantages and disadvantages are presented based on previously published measurements utilizing these techniques.

The monitoring for seepage from a CO2-EOR or geologic sequestration project might logically focus on measurements of CO2. Carbon dioxide measurements, particularly in the atmosphere will suffer some quantifiable disadvantages; relatively high atmospheric concentration for a tracer, high environmental variance, multiple natural sources, and solubility/reactivity with water. These factors combine to suggest that CO2 may not effectively serve as an early warning tracer or surface indicator of seepage.

Other methods and tracers that are discussed focus on gas exchange measured at the surface and shallow soil gas measurements utilizing a variety of tracers. These parameters include; CO2, CH4 and light hydrocarbons, stable carbon isotopic measurements of carbon-containing gases, carbon-14 content of CO2, inert gases, and artificial tracers entrained in the injected CO2. Use of secondary carbonates in the soil or upper portion of the sedimentary column and their readily measured stable isotopic ratios, and composition of shallow groundwater are included. These materials can be useful in the baseline characterization and provide evidence for fossil gas leakage from depth.},

  abstract = {CO2-enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) has emerged as a major option for productively utilizing CO2 emissions captured from electric power and other industrial plants. Not only can oil fields provide secure, well characterized sites for storing CO2, they can also provide revenues to offset the costs of capturing CO2. Though utilization of captured CO2 emissions for enhanced oil recovery has been underway for some time, further advances in CO2-EOR technology could significantly improve the technology's applicability as a revenue generator for CO2 capture and a large-scale CO2 storage option. With application of ``next generation'' CO2-EOR technologies in geologically favorable settings, the volume of CO2 stored could exceed the CO2 content of the oil produced. The paper draws significantly on the recently completed report sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory (U.S. DOE/NETL) and prepared by Advanced Resources International entitled, ``Improving Domestic Energy Security and Lowering CO2 Emissions with ``Next Generation'' CO2-EOR''.  The paper introduces the feasibility of applying ``next generation'' CO2-EOR technologies to new, challenging areas, such as to residual oil zones (ROZs) below and beyond the structural confinement of existing oil fields and to offshore oil fields. The paper provides a case study that tracks the performance and the economics of CO2-EOR in the Permian Basin of West Texas. While much of the information in the paper is drawn from the CO2-EOR experiences in North American oil fields, the paper also examines the CO2 utilization and storage potential from applying ``next generation'' CO2-EOR technology to the large oil fields of the world, drawing on extensions of work performed by Advanced Resources International for the IEA Greenhouse Gas R\&amp;D Programme.  The paper concludes with two key messages. First, with application of ``next generation'' technologies to a broader set of oil resources, the market for utilization of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery is much larger than previously assumed. Second, the revenues from the sale of captured CO2 emissions, along with research that reduces the costs of CO2 capture, can greatly accelerate the time when CCS (now CCUS) can be applied at wide scale.},

The simulations were conducted using the PROPHET model. PROPHET, originally developed by Texaco for DOE in the 1980s, models stream tubes of fluid flow between injection wells and producing wells. PROPHET is a screening tool and estimates the magnitude and timing of oil production based on a user-defined CO2 injection protocol and the porosity of the host rock, the thickness of the oil, the degree of fracturing and discontinuity within the target formation and other inputs. NETL published a similar resource assessment in February 2010; this report supersedes the earlier assessment.

  abstract = {* 1Two pH electrodes and a thermistor were used to record conditions in the surface of Esthwaite Water every 15 min over a 12-month period. Combined with approximately weekly measurements of alkalinity they allowed inorganic carbon speciation to be calculated.
* 2Large changes in pH from 7.1 to nearly 10.3, and hence in concentrations of inorganic carbon species, were measured over a year. Carbon speciation and pH varied on a diel, episodic and seasonal basis. Diel variation of up to pH 1.8 was recorded, although typical daily variation was between 0.03 and 1.06 (5 and 95 percentiles). Daily change in concentration of inorganic carbon varied between 4 and 63 mmol m-3 (5 and 95 percentiles).
* 3During lake stratification, episodes of high pH, typically of 1\textendash{}2 weeks' duration were interspersed with episodes of lower pH. These changes appeared to relate to the weather: e.g. low wind velocity, high pressure, low rainfall and high sunshine hours correlated with periods of high pH.
* 4Seasonal progression of carbon depletion generally followed stratification and the development of high phytoplankton biomass. When the lake was isothermal, the phytoplankton biomass caused relatively small amounts of carbon depletion.
* 5During autumn, winter and spring, the lake had concentrations of CO2* (free CO2) up to 0.12 mol m-3 which is nearly seven times the calculated atmospheric equilibrium concentration so the lake will accordingly be losing carbon to the atmosphere. In contrast, during periods of elevated pH the concentration of CO2* was reduced close to zero and the lake will take up atmospheric CO2. The rates of transfer between water and the atmosphere were estimated using a chemical equilibrium model with three boundary layer thicknesses. The calculations show that over a year the lake loses CO2 to the atmosphere with the current mean atmospheric level of 360 $\mu$mol mol-1, at between 0.28 and 2.80 mol m-2 yr-1. During elevated pH, rates of CO2-influx increased up to nearly tenfold as a result of chemical-enhancement by parallel flux of HCO-3. Input of CO2* to the lake from the catchment is suggested to be the main source of the carbon lost to the atmosphere.
* 6The turnover time for CO2 between the air and water was calculated to be 1 year for the gross influx and 3.3 years for the net flux. These values are less than the average water residence time of 0.25 years, which indicates that over a year inflow from streams is a more important source of inorganic carbon than the atmosphere.
* 7Influx of CO2 from the atmosphere was calculated to be roughly equivalent to between 1 and 4\% of the rates of production in the water during mid-summer indicating that this source of inorganic carbon is not a major one in this lake.
* 8Influx of CO2 from the hypolimnion was estimated on one occasion to be 6.9 10-9 mol m-2 s-1 using transfer values based on mass eddy-diffusion. These rates are equivalent to 23\% of the rate of influx of CO2 from the atmosphere on this occasion which suggests that the hypolimnion is probably a small source of inorganic carbon to the epilimnion. The exception appears to be during windy episodes when pH is depressed. Calculations based on depth-profiles of CO2* and HCO-3 suggest that the measured changes in pH can be accounted for by entrainment of hypolimnetic water into the epilimnion.
* 9The solubility product for calcite was exceeded by up to about sixfold which, although insufficient to allow homogeneous precipitation, may have allowed heterogeneous precipitation around algal particles.},

  abstract = {Abstract A considerable portion of the world's hydrocarbon endowment, and even more so if resources from the Middle East are excluded, are in carbonate reservoirs.~ Carbonate reservoirs usually exhibit low porosity and may be fractured.~These two characteristics in addition to oil-to-mixed wet rock properties usually results in low recovery.~When enhanced oil recovery (EOR) strategies are pursued, the injected fluids will likely flow is through the fracture network, bypassing oil in the rock matrix.~The high permeability in the fracture network and its low equivalent porous volume result in early breakthrough of the injected fluids.~Infill drilling programs and well conformance strategies, mostly gas and water shutoff, have been effectively used to mitigate the early breakthrough and increase oil recovery.~However, in most cases, 40 to 50\% of the original oil in place (OOIP) is not produced. A large number of EOR field projects in carbonate reservoirs have been reported in the literature since the early 70's.~The field projects showed the technological capability to increase oil recovery and estimated long run costs for their operation.~This increase in oil recovery would directly result in additional reserves extending the productive life of the different assets.~However, the technical results were not matched by their economic viability given the price environment of the time.~In some cases high upfront investments created insurmountable barriers for the technology's application despite the promise of higher returns.~In other cases, the high marginal costs eliminated all benefits from the increased recovery.~The latter was especially true for EOR processes based on chemical and thermal methods.~Over the last three decades, many improvements have reduced the cost per incremental barrel as will be seen below.~Carbon dioxide flooding (continuous or alternating with water-WAG) is the dominant EOR process in the United States, mostly due to the availability of appropriate CO2.~CO2 EOR is also the stepping stone towards sequestering carbon which could become a future business opportunity if carbon trading ever is implemented. This paper presents an overview of EOR field experiences in carbonate reservoirs in the United States, an analysis of recent efforts and discusses briefly on new opportunities for novel chemical methods.~The main EOR experiences reviewed are CO2 injection, polymer flooding, steam injection and in-situ combustion (air injection). Introduction Carbonate reservoirs are naturally fractured geologic formations characterized by heterogeneous porosity and permeability distributions.~For example, in the case of low porosity and low permeability carbonate rocks (more specifically rock matrices), the fluid flow in the reservoir can be completely dependent on the fracture network, while the matrix only plays a source role, analogous to tight sand formations and natural gas flow.~In the case of porous carbonate rocks, fracture networks can still cause uneven sweeping of the reservoir leading to early breakthrough of injected fluids in the producing wells, resulting in low recovery factors.~Given the abundance of carbonate reservoirs, they have been the subject of numerous studies that have made attempts to characterize the heterogeneities of carbonate reservoirs, classify the different types or classes of fractured reservoirs and determine how rock and fluid properties of carbonate reservoirs impact ultimate recovery [1-6].},

  abstract = {Releases of ammonia (NH3), hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from deep manure pits were investigated in two overnight tests to minimize the influence of solar radiation and sudden outdoor temperature changes using two pig fattening buildings. The rooms of the buildings had been emptied and cleaned between groups of pigs. The identical buildings had tunnel and pit ventilation fans and 2$\cdot$4 m deep under-floor pits with a surface area of 800 m2each. The first test was conducted in Building 3A. A new manure additive was applied in the pit to reduce gas and odour emission. The pit ventilation mode was used and the building was heated for about 1 h with one direct-fired propane space heater. The second test was conducted in Building 3B, in which the pit did not receive the additive application. The tunnel ventilation mode was used and the building was heated for about 2 h with two space heaters. Gas concentrations, ventilation, temperatures and differential pressure were continuously measured overnight. Gas release rates in the tests were compared with the gas release rates in the same buildings when they were fully occupied. Ammonia release rates during heating were 167$\pm$11 g/h (mean$\pm$95\% confidence interval) in the first test and 46$\pm$2 g/h in the second test, equivalent to 65$\cdot$5 and 24$\cdot$9\% of the rates from fully occupied buildings, respectively. The maximum H2S release rates measured after 1 h of heating were 9$\cdot$6 g/h in the first test and 3$\cdot$1 g/h in the second test, equivalent to 80 and 41\% of the full buildings, respectively. The maximum CO2release rates after heating were 3$\cdot$4 kg/h in the first test and 7$\cdot$0 kg/h in the second test. Heating immediately increased NH2, H2S and CO2concentrations and release rates in the under-floor pits in both tests. Ventilation modes and rates affected the indoor gas concentrations at different locations. Higher ventilation rate was related to higher gas release rate in the first test. A peculiar behaviour of H2S characterized by burst releases was found in the two tests. It was a new phenomenon not yet reported in the literature and might be related to some unexpected incidents involving acute H2S concentrations in animal facilities.},

  abstract = {Geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) is likely to be an integral component of any realistic plan to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. In conjunction with large-scale deployment of carbon storage as a technology, there is an urgent need for tools which provide reliable and quick assessments of aquifer storage performance. Previously, abandoned wells from over a century of oil and gas exploration and production have been identified as critical potential leakage paths. The practical importance of abandoned wells is emphasized by the correlation of heavy CO2 emitters (typically associated with industrialized areas) to oil and gas producing regions in North America. Herein, we describe a novel framework for predicting the leakage from large numbers of abandoned wells, forming leakage paths connecting multiple subsurface permeable formations. The framework is designed to exploit analytical solutions to various components of the problem and, ultimately, leads to a grid-free approximation to CO2 and brine leakage rates, as well as fluid distributions. We apply our model in a comparison to an established numerical solver for the underlying governing equations. Thereafter, we demonstrate the capabilities of the model on typical field data taken from the vicinity of Edmonton, Alberta. This data set consists of over 500 wells and 7 permeable formations. Results show the flexibility and utility of the solution methods, and highlight the role that analytical and semianalytical solutions can play in this important problem.},

  abstract = {Capture and subsequent injection of carbon dioxide into deep geological formations is being considered as a means to reduce anthropogenic emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere. If such a strategy is to be successful, the injected CO2 must remain within the injection formation for long periods of time, at least several hundred years. Because mature continental sedimentary basins have a century-long history of oil and gas exploration and production, they are characterized by large numbers of existing oil and gas wells. For example, more than 1 million such wells have been drilled in the state of Texas in the United States. These existing wells represent potential leakage pathways for injected CO2. To analyze leakage potential, modeling tools are needed that predict leakage rates and patterns in systems with injection and potentially leaky wells. A new semianalytical solution framework allows simple and efficient prediction of leakage rates for the case of injection of supercritical CO2 into a brine-saturated deep aquifer. The solution predicts the extent of the injected CO2 plume, provides leakage rates through an abandoned well located at an arbitrary distance from the injection well, and estimates the CO2 plume extent in the overlying aquifer into which the fluid leaks. Comparison to results from a numerical multiphase flow simulator show excellent agreement. Example calculations show the importance of outer boundary conditions, the influence of both density and viscosity contrasts in the resulting solutions, and the potential importance of local upconing around the leaky well. While several important limiting assumptions are required, the new semianalytical solution provides a simple and efficient procedure for estimation of CO2 leakage for problems involving one injection well, one leaky well, and multiple aquifers separated by impermeable aquitards.},

The properties of natural gas reservoirs and CO2 and CH4 appear to favor CSEGR. To simulate the processes of CSEGR, a module for the TOUGH2 reservoir simulator that includes water, brine, CO2, tracer, and CH4 in nonisothermal conditions has been developed. Simulations based on the Rio Vista Gas Field in the Central Valley of California are used to test the feasibility of CSEGR using CO2 separated from flue gas generated by the 680 MW Antioch gas-fired power plant.

  abstract = {Changes in the concentrations and fluxes of CO2 were monitored to a depth of 100 cm in an Andisol, under both fallow and soybean crops for a period of 1 year. Gas flux was calculated by the diffusion equation. Diel concentrations at depths less than 40 cm followed a sinusoidal pattern similar to that of the soil temperature, with the highest value being recorded in the daytime. Heavy rainfall, which closed the air pathways to the atmosphere, resulted in a higher CO2 concentration in the shallow soil layers. The subsequent decrease in the concentration in the shallow layers was accompanied by an increase for a few days in concentrations in the deeper soil layers. CO2 concentration under fallow increased with depth throughout the year except after heavy rainfall. CO2 concentration under soybean reached maximum values at depths that increased gradually from 20 to 80 cm during the growing season, suggesting the effect of root elongation. Upward CO2 fluxes decreased with depth in both fields, and the fluxes in the soil profile were high in summer and low in winter. CO2 fluxes in the upper and middle parts of the profile under soybean were higher than those under fallow during the growing season. CO2 fluxes from the soil surface calculated by the diffusion equation and measured by the closed chamber method showed a correlation coefficient of 0.89 except after heavy rainfall. Total CO2 fluxes from the surface estimated from measurements throughout a year were 3522 g m-2 under fallow and 4975 g m-2 under soybean. The downward flux of CO2 dissolved in the soil water was found to be negligible in comparison with the CO2 flux from the soil surface.

EGR (Enhanced natural gas recovery) with CO2 sequestration offers the prospect of significant environmental and economic benefits by increasing gas recovery while simultaneously sequestering the greenhouse gas. Field-scale deployment is currently limited as the risks of contamination of the produced gas by injected CO2 are poorly understood. Reservoir simulations offer a method to quantify the risk but only if sufficiently accurate. For the first time, finite element simulations are presented for several EGR scenarios that incorporate the most accurate models available for fluid mixture and rock properties. Specifically, the GERG-2008 EOS (equation of state) is utilised to describe the supercritical fluid mixture's density, as are reference correlations linked to the most accurate experimental data available for diffusivity and viscosity. Realistic values for rock dispersivity and tortuosity determined from high-accuracy core-flooding and NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) experiments were also integrated. The relative impacts of these properties were investigated for a benchmark layered reservoir with a quarter 5-spot well pattern. Recovery efficiency at different CO2 injection rates was also investigated and was determined to be the dominant consideration: a 100-fold rate increase improved recovery from 53\% to 69\% while CO2 breakthrough time decreased by less than expected. Collectively, these results emphasise the importance of accurate reservoir simulations for EGR.},

The similarity of two commonly used methods of measuring CO2 fluxes from forest soils was assessed by directly comparing the sodalime method with a static chamber technique using gas chromatographic analysis of CO2 -concentration changes during short-term incubations. A paired-chamber sampling design was applied in 11 different forest stands to examine the two methods across a range of soil-CO2 efflux rates. Carbon dioxide efflux rates were highly variable within sites, and showed no spatial autocorrelation. No consistent differences in measured rates of CO2 efflux were observed between the two methods, indicating that either method may be applied to the range of mean daily rates encountered in this study (1.7\textendash{}11.4 g m-2 d-1). A large number of chambers can be deployed with the soda-lime method, but no information on diel variations in efflux rates is obtained. The short-term incubation technique, on the other hand, can be utilized to simultaneously monitor several trace gases and diel trends in flux rates. Selection between the methods should be based on the hypotheses being tested or on practical constraints.},

At all times the Hudson was supersaturated in CO2 with respect to the atmosphere. PCO                        2 in surface water averaged 1125$\pm$403 (SD) $\mu$atm while the atmosphere averaged 416$\pm$68 $\mu$atm. Weekly samples at a single, mid-river station showed a pronounced and reproducible seasonal cycle with highest values ($\sim$2000 $\mu$atm) in mid-to-late summer, and lowest values ($\sim$500 $\mu$atm) generally in late winter. Samples taken along the length of the 190-km section of river showed a general decline in CO2 from north to south. This decline was most pronounced in summer and very slight in spring. Diel and vertical variation were small relative to the standing stock of CO2. Over six diel cycles, all taken during the algal growing season, the mean range was 300$\pm$114 $\mu$atm. CO2 tended to increase slightly with depth, but the gradient was small, about 0.5 $\mu$mol m-1, or an increase of 190 $\mu$atm from top to within 1 m of the bottom. For a large subset of the samples (n=452) we also calculated CO2 from measurements of pH and total DIC. Calculated and measured values of CO2 were in reasonably good agreement and a regression of calculated versus measured values had a slope of 0.85$\pm$0.04 and an r2 of 0.60. Combining our measurements with recent experimental studies of gas exchange in the Hudson, we estimate that the Hudson releases CO2 at a rate of 70\textendash{}162 g C m-2 yr-1 from the river to the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {On 15 August, 1984, a lethal gas burst issued from a submerged 96-m-deep crater in Lake Monoun in Cameroun, western Africa, killing 37 people. The event was associated with a landslide from the eastern crater rim, which slumped into deep water. Waters below 50 m are anoxic, dominated by high Fe2+ ($\sim$600 mg/l) and HCO3- ($\geq$ 1900 mg/l), anoxic and supersaturated with siderite, which is a major component of the crater floor sediments. The unusually high Fe2+ levels are attributed to reduction of laterite-derived ferric iron gradually brought into the lake as loess and in river input. Sulfur compounds are below detection limits in both water and gas. Gases effervescing from depressurized deep waters are dominantly CO2 with minor CH4, having $\delta$13C of -7.18 and -54.8 per mil, respectively. Bacterial decomposition of organic matter may account for the methane, but 14C of lake water indicates that only 10\% of the carbon is modern, giving an apparent age of 18,000 years. The dominant source of carbon is therefore attributed to long-term emission of CO2 as volcanic exhalation from vents within the crater, which led to gradual build-up of HCO3- in the lake. The density stratification of the lake may have been upset by an earthquake and underwater landslide on 15 August, which triggered overturn of the lake and caused nucleation of CO2 in the deep water. The resultant ebullition of CO2 from deep lake waters led to a gas burst at the surface and locally generated a water wave up to 5 m high. People travelling through the gas cloud were asphyxiated, presumably from CO2, and suffered skin discoloration from unidentified components.},

  abstract = {Prediction about reservoir temperature change during carbon dioxide injection requires consideration of all, often subtle, thermal effects. In particular, Joule\textendash{}Thomson cooling (JTC) and the viscous heat dissipation (VHD) effect are factors that cause flowing fluid temperature to differ from the static formation temperature. In this work, warm-back behavior (thermal recovery after injection completed), as well as JTC and VHD effects, at a multi-layered depleted gas reservoir are demonstrated numerically. OpenGeoSys (OGS) is able to solve coupled partial differential equations for pressure, temperature and mole-fraction of each component of the mixture with a combination of monolithic and staggered approaches. The Galerkin finite element approach is adapted for space discretization of governing equations, whereas for temporal discretization, a generalized implicit single-step scheme is used. For numerical modeling of warm-back behavior, we chose a simplified test case of carbon dioxide injection. This test case is numerically solved by using OGS and FeFlow simulators independently. OGS differs from FeFlow in the capability of representing multi-componential effects on warm-back behavior. We verify both code results by showing the close comparison of shut-in temperature profiles along the injection well. As the JTC cooling rate is inversely proportional to the volumetric heat capacity of the solid matrix, the injection layers are cooled faster as compared to the non-injection layers. The shut-in temperature profiles are showing a significant change in reservoir temperature; hence it is important to account for thermal effects in injection monitoring.},

  abstract = {In mature Phragmites australis and Scirpus lacustris vegetated sediment methane was emitted almost exclusively by plant-mediated transport, whereas in unvegetated, but otherwise identical sediment, methane was emitted almost exclusively by ebullition. Diel variations in methane emission, with highest emission rates at daytime and emission peaks following sunrise, were demonstrated for Phragmites and Scirpus. The diel difference and magnitude of the emission peaks were much smaller for Scirpus than for Phragmites. In contrast to Phragmites, methane concentrations within Scirpus stems did not change significantly over the diel period. These patterns are consistent with a two-way transport mechanism for Phragmites (convective at daytime and diffusive at night-time) and an all day diffusive mechanism for Scirpus. The patterns could not be accounted for by diel variation in air and sediment temperature, plant transpiration, or photosynthetically coupled methane production. Comparison of the experimentally derived ratio of methane emission in helium and nitrogen under light and dark conditions with the theoretical derived ratio (calculated according to the kinetic theory of gases) confirmed the exploitation of the different transport mechanism for Phragmites and Scirpus. Methane emission from Phragmites correlated significantly with incident light, which probably drove the pressure differential associated with thermally induced convection. Decrease of the radial resistance of Scirpus stems for methane transport under light compared to dark conditions, in combination with morphological characteristics of the plant species, suggested that stomatal aperture, regulated by light, controls methane emission from Scirpus. Diel variation in bubble emission from the non-vegetated sediment coincided with sediment temperature changes. The results have important implications for sampling and scaling strategies for estimating methane emission from wetlands.},

The top of the reservoir lies approximately 3800~meters below sea level, and the ambient temperature of the reservoir is over 127~$^\circ$C. The K12-B gas field has been producing natural gas from 1987 onwards and is currently operated by GDF SUEZ E\&P Nederland B.V. The natural gas has an initial CO2 content of 13\%, which is relatively high. Since the start of the gas production the CO2 component has been separated from the natural gas stream on-site and since 2004 part of the separated CO2 is re-injected into the gas field. In 2004 a demonstration project commenced where CO2 was re-injected into K12-B. The goal was to investigate the feasibility of CO2 injection and storage in depleted natural gas fields. More than 6 years later CO2 injection is still taking place and numerous monitoring techniques have been applied in order to get a better understanding of various aspects of underground CO2 storage in nearly depleted gas fields. Over the years monitoring activities have mainly focused on the well integrity and on the behavior of the CO2 in the well and reservoir. The cap rock present at K12-B consists of hundreds of meters of rock salts from the Zechstein Super Group. The most likely migration pathway for any gas, should migration occur at all is therefore along the well bores. Establishing the conditions of wells is of great importance for safety issues. Some of the tools which have been used will be discussed. Another goal for the various monitoring activities is to gain a better understanding of the behavior of the CO2 in the injection wells and the migration of the CO2 in the reservoir. How the CO2 migrates in the reservoir is important as regards the assessment of the potential for enhanced gas recovery (EGR) by CO2 injection.},

Diel soil temperature regimes affected methane emission rates. Under ambient temperature regime, methane fluxes increased with rising soil temperature in the morning and reached a maximum in the early afternoon, then decreased rapidly and leveled off at night while soil temperature declined gradually till sunrise next morning. Changing diet soil temperature regimes resulted in changes in diel methane emission patterns irrespective of the amplitudes of the methane emission rates. Using Arrhenius equation to simulate temperature dependence of methane emission variations indicated that soil temperature is a major factor controlling diel methane emission variations (r2 = 0.78).},

  abstract = {Methane emissions from flooded rice grown under greenhouse conditions were monitored using a closed chamber technique. The three rice cultivars showed similar diel emission patterns though the amplitudes differed. Variation in emissions (maximum emission rate) from the different cultivars ranged from 0.164\textendash{}0.241 mg/pot/h at tillering stage, 0.714\textendash{}2.334 mg/pot/h at heading stage, 0.399\textendash{}1.393 mg/pot/h at ripening stage. The methane emissions increased in the morning at accelerating rates, reached a maximum in the early afternoon, then decreased rapidly to constant rates during the night. The diel emission pattern was modeled using a Gaussian equation for daytime, and a constant for nocturnal emissions. Applying an Arrhenius equation, more than 90\% of the diel variation of methane emissions could be predicted from soil temperature fluctuations. The predictions improved by using a diffusion model based on soil temperature and dissolved methane concentrations in soil solution. Soil temperature and methane concentration in soil solution are the two major factors controlling diel methane emissions.},

  abstract = {Geological sequestration of CO2 in depleted oil reservoirs is a potentially useful strategy for greenhouse gas management and can be combined with enhanced oil recovery. Development of methods to estimate CO2 leakage rates is essential to assure that storage objectives are being met at sequestration facilities. Perfluorocarbon tracers (PFTs) were added as three 12 h slugs at about one week intervals during the injection of 2090 tons of CO2 into the West Pearl Queen (WPQ) depleted oil formation, sequestration pilot study site located in SE New Mexico. The CO2 was injected into the Permian Queen Formation. Leakage was monitored in soil\textendash{}gas using a matrix of 40 capillary adsorbent tubes (CATs) left in the soil for periods ranging from days to months. The tracers, perfluoro-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane (PDCH), perfluorotrimethylcyclohexane (PTCH) and perfluorodimethylcyclobutane (PDCB), were analyzed using thermal desorption, and gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Monitoring was designed to look for immediate leakage, such as at the injection well bore and at nearby wells, and to develop the technology to estimate overall CO2 leak rates based on the use of PFTs. Tracers were detected in soil\textendash{}gas at the monitoring sites 50 m from the injection well within days of injection. Tracers continued to escape over the following years. Leakage appears to have emanated from the vicinity of the injection well in a radial pattern to about 100 m and in directional patterns to 300 m. Leakage rates were estimated for the 3 tracers from each of the 4 sets of CATs in place following the start of CO2 injection. Leakage was fairly uniform during this period. As a first approximation, the CO2 leak rate was estimated at about 0.0085\% of the total CO2 sequestered per annum.},

Nearly 18,407 short tons (1.670 \texttimes{} 107 kg) of CO2 were injected into 3 seams of the Fruitland coal between July 2008 and April 2009. Between September 18 and October 30, 2008, two additions of approximately 20 L each of perfluorocarbon (PFC) tracers were mixed with the CO2 at the injection wellhead. PFC tracers in soil-gas and in the atmosphere were monitored over a period of 2 years using a rectangular array of permanent installations. Additional monitors were placed near existing well bores and at other locations of potential leakage identified during the pre-injection site survey. Monitoring was conducted using sorbent containing tubes to collect any released PFC tracer from soil-gas or the atmosphere. Near-surface monitoring activities also included CO2 surface flux and carbon isotopes, soil-gas hydrocarbon levels, and electrical conductivity in the soil. The value of the PFC tracers was demonstrated when a significant leakage event was detected near an offset production well. Subsurface characterization activities, including 3D seismic interpretation and attribute analysis, were conducted to evaluate reservoir integrity and the potential that leakage of injected CO2 might occur. Leakage from the injection reservoir was not detected. PFC tracers made breakthroughs at 2 of 3 offset wells which were not otherwise directly observable in produced gases containing 20\textendash{}30\% CO2. These results have aided reservoir geophysical and simulation investigations to track the underground movement of CO2. 3D seismic analysis provided a possible interpretation for the order of appearance of tracers at production wells.},

Other geologic formations, such as depleted petroleum reservoirs, deep saline aquifers and others have received considerable attention as sites for sequestering CO2.

Key issues for geologic sequestration include potential storage capacity, the storage integrity of the geologic host, and the chemical and physical processes initiated by the deep underground injection of CO2. The review topics include (i) the estimated CO2 storage capacity of coal, along with the estimated amount and composition of coalbed gas; (ii) an evaluation of the coal seam properties relevant to CO2 sequestration, such as density, surface area, porosity, diffusion, permeability, transport, rank, adsorption/desorption, shrinkage/swelling, and thermochemical reactions; and (iii) a treatment of how coalbed methane (CBM) recovery and CO2-enhanced coalbed methane (ECBM) recovery are performed (in addition, the use of adsorption/desorption isotherms, injection well characterization, and gas injection are described, as well as reservoir screening criteria and field tests operating in the United States and abroad); (iv) leak detection using direct measurements, chemical tracers, and seismic monitoring; (v) economic considerations using CO2 injection, flue gas injection, and predictive tools for CO2 capture/sequestration decisions; (vi) environmental safety and health (ES (vii) an initial set of working hypotheses concerning the chemical, physical, and thermodynamic events initiated when CO2 is injected into a coalbed; and (viii) a discussion of gaps in our knowledge base that will require further research and development.

  abstract = {Abstract The topic of global warming as a result of increased atmospheric CO2 concentration is arguably the most important environmental issue that the world faces today. It is a global problem that will need to be solved on a global level. The link between anthropogenic emissions of CO2 with increased atmospheric CO2 levels and, in turn, with increased global temperatures has been well established and accepted by the world. International organizations such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have been formed to address this issue. Three options are being explored to stabilize atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and global temperatures without severely and negatively impacting standard of living: (1) increasing energy efficiency, (2) switching to less carbon-intensive sources of energy, and (3) carbon sequestration. To be successful, all three options must be used in concert. The third option is the subject of this review. Specifically, this review will cover the capture and geologic sequestration of CO2 generated from large point sources, namely fossil-fuel-fired power gasification plants. Sequestration of CO2 in geological formations is necessary to meet the President?s Global Climate Change Initiative target of an 18\% reduction in GHG intensity by 2012. Further, the best strategy to stabilize the atmospheric concentration of CO2 results from a multifaceted approach where sequestration of CO2 into geological formations is combined with increased efficiency in electric power generation and utilization, increased conservation, increased use of lower carbonintensity fuels, and increased use of nuclear energy and renewables. This review covers the separation and capture of CO2 from both flue gas and fuel gas using wet scrubbing technologies, dry regenerable sorbents, membranes, cryogenics, pressure and temperature swing adsorption, and other advanced concepts. Existing commercial CO2 capture facilities at electric power-generating stations based on the use of monoethanolamine are described, as is the Rectisol process used by Dakota Gasification to separate and capture CO2 from a coal gasifier. Two technologies for storage of the captured CO2 are reviewed?sequestration in deep unmineable coalbeds with concomitant recovery of CH4 and sequestration in deep saline aquifers. Key issues for both of these techniques include estimating the potential storage capacity, the storage integrity, and the physical and chemical processes that are initiated by injecting CO2 underground. Recent studies using computer modeling as well as laboratory and field experimentation are presented here. In addition, several projects have been initiated in which CO2 is injected into a deep coal seam or saline aquifer. The current status of several such projects is discussed. Included is a commercial-scale project in which a million tons of CO2 are injected annually into an aquifer under the North Sea in Norway. The review makes the case that this can all be accomplished safely with off-the-shelf technologies. However, substantial research and development must be performed to reduce the cost, decrease the risks, and increase the safety of sequestration technologies. This review also includes discussion of possible problems related to deep injection of CO2 . There are safety concerns that need to be addressed because of the possibilities of leakage to the surface and induced seismic activity. These issues are presented along with a case study of a similar incident in the past. It is clear that monitoring and verification of storage will be a crucial part of all geological sequestration practices so that such problems may be avoided. Available techniques include direct measurement of CO2 and CH4 surface soil fluxes, the use of chemical tracers, and underground 4-D seismic monitoring. Ten new hypotheses were formulated to describe what happens when CO2 is pumped into a coal seam. These hypotheses provide significant insight into the fundamental chemical, physical, and thermodynamic phenomena that occur during coal seam sequestration of CO2 .},

  abstract = {Coalbed methane (CBM) is a potential green energy supply for addressing the worldwide energy crisis. However, the recovery of economically viable amounts of methane requires the application of production-enhancement techniques. The greater effectiveness of enhanced coalbed methane (ECBM) recovery compared to traditional pressure depletion and hydraulic stimulation techniques has been identified in terms of higher CBM recovery with minimal pollution risk and the ability to contribute to CO2 sequestration. Gas transport behavior in a coal seam is the governing factor for ECBM recovery, which includes sorption/desorption and diffusion in the matrix and advective flux in cleats. The interactions among sorption, diffusion, and flow indicate the complexity and abstruseness of gas transport in coal. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to provide comprehensive knowledge of the gas transport process in deep coal seams, particularly in relation to the ECBM process. According to the review, the dual-porosity system in coal provides sorption sites, and CO2 has much higher adsorption affinity to coal compared to that of CH4. Gas adsorption capacities for CH4 and CO2 are greatly reduced with temperature and the presence of moisture and increased with pressure. However, the adsorption capacity for supercritical CO2 decreases with increasing pressure due to changes in the associated CO2 properties. Regarding the diffusion process, CO2 has the highest diffusivity for its smallest kinetic diameter and the diffusion capability may be reduced with the existence of moisture for moisture adsorption-induced coal swelling. Seam temperature has a positive influence on gas diffusion due to the enhanced kinetic energy and, the effect of pressure on diffusion is still open to debate. Upon sorption/diffusion, gas moves toward the cleat system through gas flow, which is controlled by permeability and is in turn greatly altered by gas adsorption/desorption-induced swelling/shrinkage effects during ECBM recovery. With high chemical reactive potential, CO2 creates the greatest coal matrix swelling for its higher adsorption capacity. Seam permeability increases with increasing injection pressure due to the associated pore expansion and reduces with enhanced swelling. Coal mass swelling reduces with increasing temperature due to the exothermic nature of gas adsorption. Dewatering coal seams increases coal permeability through the reduced moisture content that provides more sorption places for CO2 adsorption. However, this in turn may cause reduced permeability through the enhanced swelling effect.},

  abstract = {In this study, we aimed to understand the influence of plant type on the monthly variations of diel CH4 fluxes from Spartina alterniflora and Suaeda salsa of coastal salt marshes at three growth stages (July, August and September). Dissolved CH4 concentrations in porewater and sediment redox potentials were monitored, as were aboveground plant biomass and stem densities. CH4 fluxes exhibited clear monthly variations and peaked in September in the S. alterniflora and S. salsa mesocosms. However, no discernible diel variation was observed in the CH4 flux in the S. salsa mesocosm, probably due to its weak gas transport capacity. By contrast, notable diel variations of CH4 flux with the peak of 1.42 and 3.67 mg CH4 m-2 h-1 at 12:00 and the lowest of 0.75 and 2.11 mg CH4 m-2 h-1 at 3:00 or 6:00 were observed in the S. alterniflora mesocosm on 11 August and 11 September, respectively, but not in July mainly due to low plant biomass masking diel variations in the porewater CH4 concentration. The ratios of the maximum flux to minimum flux over the course of the day in the S. alterniflora mesocosm on 10 July, 11 August and 11 September were 1.28, 1.89 and 1.76, respectively, and corresponding values for porewater CH4 concentration were 1.31, 1.39 and 1.17, respectively. CH4 flux significantly correlated with CH4 concentration in porewater, and both were significantly related to air temperature. These findings indicate that CH4 production and CH4 flux at the middle growth stage (August) exhibited greater responses to changes in air temperature, which in turn induced the higher diel variation. The higher diel cycle for CH4 flux in August than in September was likely due to the higher proportion of CH4 oxidized during diffusion within the aerenchyma system. Our results suggest that the extent of diel variations in CH4 flux may have depended on the gas transport capacity of plants, and the highest diel variation occurred at the middle growth stage.},
